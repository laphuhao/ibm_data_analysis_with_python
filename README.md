Data analysis with Python to build and evaluate data models includes:
- collecting and importing data 
- cleaning, preparing & formatting data 
- data frame manipulation 
- summarizing data 
- building machine learning regression models 
- model refinement 
- creating data pipelines 

I learned how to import data from multiple sources, clean and wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful data visualizations.
And predict future trends from data by developing linear, multiple, polynomial regression models & pipelines and learning how to evaluate them.
